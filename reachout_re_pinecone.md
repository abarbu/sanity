Hi Kirill,

Please pardon the unusual channel :)</br>
I'm [Edo Liberty](https://edoliberty.github.io//) and I want to connect about equiring the github pinecone handle from you.

I'm the founder of a small startup called [HyperCube](https://www.hypercube.ai/). We are launching a new product called Pinecone and would love to be able to use the pinecone github handle. I will really appreciate it if you would consider letting us have it. I'm happy to compensate you for the hassle of moving your code. 

What would be the best email or phone number to contact with you?

Edo Liberty</br>
